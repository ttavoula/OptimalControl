# Optimal Control for a 2-DOF Drone and Experimental Validation

In this project, we simulate (i) a function of a final state fixed Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and (ii) an LQ Tracker (LQT). Simulation results show that the LQT is a better fit for real-world
control tasks because it is safe, reliable, and efficient. Finally, we test the LQT method on a real 2-DOF drone platform to perform a fully automatic mission.
